&#8220;There are publicists, and then there is Lauren Cerand,&#8221; said Flavorwire, counting her among &#8220;35 Writers Who Run the Literary Internet,&#8221; in 2014.

Her work in 2015 includes publicity for the [Windham Campbell Prizes][1], which will convene its international literary festival at Yale in September; and the annual Authors Guild Dinner, honoring Joan Didion, in April; as well as [*We Are Pirates*][2] by Daniel Handler (Bloomsbury, February); [*The Boatmaker*][3] by [John Benditt][4] (Tin House Books, February); [*The Truth is We Are Perfect*][5] by Janaka Stucky ([Third Man Books][6], April); [*Small Victories: A Print Collector&#8217;s Story*][7] by [Dave H. Williams][8] (Godine, April); *[Lunch with a Bigot: The Writer in the World][9],* by [Amitava Kumar][10] (Duke University Press; May); *Bad Sex* by Clancy Martin ([Tyrant Books][11], September); *Old Silk Road* by Brandon Caro (Post Hill Press, October); and *Drawing Blood* by [Molly Crabapple][12] (HarperCollins, December).

Her confirmed projects in 2016 include publicity for the Windham Campbell Prizes; *[Anything That Burns You: A Portrait of Lola Ridge, Radical Poet][13]* by Terese Svoboda (Schaffner Press, January); *[Square Wave][14],* a debut novel by Mark de Silva (Two Dollar Radio, February); and, with an as-yet-to-be-scheduled publication date, a debut memoir of coming-of-age, and into her own life as an artist, by a member of one of America&#8217;s most recognizable families.

Lauren has been called one of the “cultural gatekeepers in the literary world” by *Time Out New York*, and among the &#8220;Best of New York&#8221; by the *Village Voice.* According to the [Nervous Breakdown][15], “Lauren Cerand is a singular powerhouse of vision and personality… there isn’t a hotter freelance publicist in the country.” She is known &#8220;as a freelancer of exquisite taste who only takes on projects that interest her,” says the [Millions][16]; a &#8220;talented publicist,&#8221; says the *[Wall Street Journal][17];* “a social media pioneer,” says* Svenska Dagbladet* (Swedish Daily Paper); and a &#8220;specialist in literary social networking,&#8221; says the *Telegraph* (UK). According to the [Rumpus][18], Lauren is “in that rare category of people in publishing who are both arbiters of taste and a kind of ‘brand’ in and of themselves.”

*Poets & Writers* commissioned her articles, “[Social Media for Authors: Forever in Search of Buzz][19],&#8221; and “[How to Use Twitter to Connect With Readers][20].&#8221; She regularly speaks to audiences as varied as publishing professionals at [Book Expo America][21] and [Penguin Books in London][22], and faculty within the [Psychology Department at New York University][23]. Her speaking engagements in 2015 include appearances at the [Tennessee Williams New Orleans Literary Festival][24], [Yale Writers Conference][25], and [New School Summer Writers Colony][26].

Lauren is a graduate of Cornell University.
