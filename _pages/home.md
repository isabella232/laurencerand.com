“There are publicists, and then there is Lauren Cerand,” said Flavorwire, counting her among “35 Writers Who Run the Literary Internet,” in 2014.

In more than a dozen years as an independent public relations representative and strategic consultant in New York, she has advised everyone from shipping and private equity firms to scientists, her neighborhood children's bookstore, and advocates for the arts, and especially enjoys working with clients in London and across Europe, and on cross-cultural projects. This year, she'll focus on new endeavors by Tayari Jones, Molly Crabapple, Daniel Handler (as well as Lemony Snicket), the Windham-Campbell Prizes, and Relegation Books.

Before she was thirty, Lauren was said to be both one of the “cultural gatekeepers in the literary world” by&nbsp;*Time Out New York*&nbsp;and among the “Best of New York” by the&nbsp;*Village Voice*. She is also known as a “talented publicist,” says the&nbsp;[*Wall Street Journal*](http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-preparation-for-the-next-life-became-a-big-hit-for-tyrant-1421351378?tesla=y); “a social media pioneer,” says&nbsp;*Svenska Dagbladet*&nbsp;(Swedish Daily Paper); and a “specialist in literary social networking,” says the&nbsp;*Telegraph*&nbsp;(UK). According to the&nbsp;[*Rumpus*](http://therumpus.net/2012/05/lit-link-round-up-16/), Lauren is “in that rare category of people in publishing who are both arbiters of taste and a kind of ‘brand’ in and of themselves.”

Sought after for her perspective and breadth of expertise, she began speaking to audiences about the possibilities for using online media to communicate with the public in 2006, with commissioned talks for editorial, marketing and publicity staff at Farrar, Straus and Giroux in New York in the spring, and Penguin Books in London later that year. She most recently appeared at the Mors Tua Vita Mea writing workshop, held in the shadow of castelletto ruins in Sezze, Italy, in October 2017. Lauren is a graduate of Cornell University, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial and Labor Relations. She lives in Brooklyn, and is currently learning Italian.
