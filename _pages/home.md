“There are publicists, and then there is Lauren Cerand,” said Flavorwire, counting her among “35 Writers Who Run the Literary Internet,” in 2014.

Her publicity clients in 2016 include presenters of literary programming and festivals such as the Windham-Campbell Prizes and Festival Neue Literatur; in the media, CNET’s “Technically Literate” monthly series of new original fiction, and&nbsp;*The Baffler*&nbsp;magazine; independent publishers like Text Publishing (for&nbsp;*Good People*&nbsp;by Nir Baram and&nbsp;*Everywhere I Look*&nbsp;by Helen Garner) and Relegation Books (for&nbsp;*A Single Happened Thing*&nbsp;by Daniel Paisner and&nbsp;*The Loved Ones*&nbsp;by Sonya Chung); and the extraordinary authors Daniel Handler (as well as Lemony Snicket), Terese Svoboda (*Anything That Burns You: A Portrait of Lola Ridge, Radical Poet*), Mark de Silva (*Square Wave*), Nayomi Munaweera (*What Lies Between Us*), Chris Abani (*The Face: Cartography of the Void*), Paul Vidich (*An Honorable Man*), Frances Stroh (*Beer Money*), S.J. Watson (*Second Life*), Marcy Dermansky (*The Red Car*), and Jonathan Baumbach (*The Pavilion of Former Wives: Stories and Shots in the Dark: Collected Film Criticism*).

Lauren has been called one of the “cultural gatekeepers in the literary world” by *Time Out New York*, and among the “Best of New York” by the *Village Voice*. According to the [Nervous Breakdown](http://www.thenervousbreakdown.com/gfrangello/2011/05/new-directions-in-publishing-public-relations-representative-lauren-cerand/), “Lauren Cerand is a singular powerhouse of vision and personality… there isn’t a hotter freelance publicist in the country.” She is known “as a freelancer of exquisite taste who only takes on projects that interest her,” says *[the Millions](http://www.themillions.com/2012/04/adventures-in-self-publishing-dallas-hudgens-wake-up-were-here.html)*; a “talented publicist,” says the *[Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-preparation-for-the-next-life-became-a-big-hit-for-tyrant-1421351378?tesla=y)*; “a social media pioneer,” says Svenska Dagbladet (Swedish Daily Paper); and a “specialist in literary social networking,” says the *Telegraph* (UK). According to the *[Rumpus](http://therumpus.net/2012/05/lit-link-round-up-16/)*, Lauren is “in that rare category of people in publishing who are both arbiters of taste and a kind of ‘brand’ in and of themselves.”

Lauren is a graduate of Cornell University. She lives in Brooklyn.
