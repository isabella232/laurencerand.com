“There are publicists, and then there is Lauren Cerand,” said Flavorwire, counting her among “35 Writers Who Run the Literary Internet,” in 2014.

Her clients in 2017 include storytellers, journalists, poets, scientists, advocates for the arts and more, such as Daniel Handler (*All The Dirty Parts*, August), who is also known under the pen name, Lemony Snicket (new:&nbsp;*A Series of Unfortunate Events*&nbsp;on Netflix); the Windham-Campbell Prizes, celebrating a fifth year of giving more than $1,000,000 to writers annually via “the call of a lifetime;” and Jonathan Baumbach (*The Pavilion of Former Wives*, available now), Min Jin Lee (*Pachinko*, available now), Brian McGreevy (*The Lights*, available now), Eileen Myles (*Afterglow*, September), Relegation Books' next title (October), and Tayari Jones (*An American Marriage*, February 2018).

Lauren has been called one of the “cultural gatekeepers in the literary world” by *Time Out New York*, and among the “Best of New York” by the *Village Voice*. According to the [Nervous Breakdown](http://www.thenervousbreakdown.com/gfrangello/2011/05/new-directions-in-publishing-public-relations-representative-lauren-cerand/), “Lauren Cerand is a singular powerhouse of vision and personality… there isn’t a hotter freelance publicist in the country.” She is known “as a freelancer of exquisite taste who only takes on projects that interest her,” says *[the Millions](http://www.themillions.com/2012/04/adventures-in-self-publishing-dallas-hudgens-wake-up-were-here.html)*; a “talented publicist,” says the *[Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-preparation-for-the-next-life-became-a-big-hit-for-tyrant-1421351378?tesla=y)*; “a social media pioneer,” says Svenska Dagbladet (Swedish Daily Paper); and a “specialist in literary social networking,” says the *Telegraph* (UK). According to the *[Rumpus](http://therumpus.net/2012/05/lit-link-round-up-16/)*, Lauren is “in that rare category of people in publishing who are both arbiters of taste and a kind of ‘brand’ in and of themselves.”

Lauren is a graduate of Cornell University. She lives in Brooklyn.
