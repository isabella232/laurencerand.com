Lauren has been called one of the “cultural gatekeepers in the literary world” by _Time Out New York_, and among the “Best of New York” by the _Village Voice._ According to the [Nervous Breakdown](http://www.thenervousbreakdown.com/gfrangello/2011/05/new-directions-in-publishing-public-relations-representative-lauren-cerand/), “Lauren Cerand is a singular powerhouse of vision and personality… there isn’t a hotter freelance publicist in the country.” She is known “as a freelancer of exquisite taste who only takes on projects that interest her,” says the [Millions](http://www.themillions.com/2012/04/adventures-in-self-publishing-dallas-hudgens-wake-up-were-here.html); a “talented publicist,” says the _[Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-preparation-for-the-next-life-became-a-big-hit-for-tyrant-1421351378?tesla=y);_ “a social media pioneer,” says _Svenska Dagbladet_ (Swedish Daily Paper); and a “specialist in literary social networking,” says the _Telegraph_(UK). According to the [Rumpus](http://therumpus.net/2012/05/lit-link-round-up-16/), Lauren is “in that rare category of people in publishing who are both arbiters of taste and a kind of ‘brand’ in and of themselves.”

_Poets & Writers_ commissioned her articles, “[Social Media for Authors: Forever in Search of Buzz](http://www.pw.org/content/social_media_for_authors_forever_in_search_of_buzz),” and “[How to Use Twitter to Connect With Readers](http://www.pw.org/content/network_how_to_use_twitter_to_connect_with_readers).” She regularly speaks to audiences as varied as publishing professionals at [Book Expo America](http://blip.tv/bookexpo-america/bookexpo-america-2009-7x20x21-lauren-cerand-2318362) and [Penguin Books in London](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U85UHen-y3s), and faculty within the [Psychology Department at New York University](http://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/pubs/pelli2010media-workshop.html). Her speaking engagements in 2015 include appearances at the [Tennessee Williams New Orleans Literary Festival](http://www.tennesseewilliams.net/), [Yale Writers Conference](http://summer.yale.edu/ywc), and [New School Summer Writers Colony](http://www.newschool.edu/summerwriters/).
