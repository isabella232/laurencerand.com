“There are publicists, and then there is Lauren Cerand,” said Flavorwire, counting her among “35 Writers Who Run the Literary Internet,” in 2014.

Her work in 2016 include continuing publicity for the Windham-Campbell Prizes, Daniel Handler (and Lemony Snicket), plus, for the first time this year, the Festival Neue Literatur, and the launch of CNET's "Technically Literate" monthly series of new original fiction, as well as campaigns to promote the publication of, this winter,&nbsp;*Anything That Burns You: A Portrait of Lola Ridge, Radical Poet*&nbsp;by Terese Svoboda,&nbsp;*Square Wave*&nbsp;by Mark de Silva, and&nbsp;*What Lies Between Us*&nbsp;by Nayomi Munaweera; and in the spring,&nbsp;*An Honorable Man*&nbsp;by Paul Vidich,&nbsp;*A Single Happened Thing*&nbsp;by Daniel Paisner, and&nbsp;*Beer Money*&nbsp;by Frances Stroh; and in the fall,&nbsp;*Good People*&nbsp;by Nir Baram,&nbsp;*The Red Car*&nbsp;by Marcy Dermansky, and&nbsp;*The Loved Ones*&nbsp;by Sonya Chung.

Lauren has been called one of the “cultural gatekeepers in the literary world” by *Time Out New York*, and among the “Best of New York” by the *Village Voice*. According to the [Nervous Breakdown](http://www.thenervousbreakdown.com/gfrangello/2011/05/new-directions-in-publishing-public-relations-representative-lauren-cerand/), “Lauren Cerand is a singular powerhouse of vision and personality… there isn’t a hotter freelance publicist in the country.” She is known “as a freelancer of exquisite taste who only takes on projects that interest her,” says *[the Millions](http://www.themillions.com/2012/04/adventures-in-self-publishing-dallas-hudgens-wake-up-were-here.html)*; a “talented publicist,” says the *[Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-preparation-for-the-next-life-became-a-big-hit-for-tyrant-1421351378?tesla=y)*; “a social media pioneer,” says Svenska Dagbladet (Swedish Daily Paper); and a “specialist in literary social networking,” says the *Telegraph* (UK). According to the *[Rumpus](http://therumpus.net/2012/05/lit-link-round-up-16/)*, Lauren is “in that rare category of people in publishing who are both arbiters of taste and a kind of ‘brand’ in and of themselves.”

Lauren is a graduate of Cornell University. She lives in Brooklyn.
