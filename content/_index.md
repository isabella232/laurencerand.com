In 2019, she took a sabbatical year to immerse herself in the study of jewelry design and creation full-time in Florence, Italy, and learn more about the Italian language and way of life. While there, she also published an essay in Dining in Place, the online food and culture magazine based in Melbourne, and had another essay shortlisted for the Mollie Salisbury Cup memoir writing competition, administered by the Garden Museum in London. 

Lauren has returned to New York in Fall 2020, and looks forward to enjoying the city in the best season, at the height of her creative powers. If you have a consulting project of any size that you’d like to talk with her about, please be in touch.
