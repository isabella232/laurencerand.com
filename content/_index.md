Lauren Cerand is “a highly sought-after independent publicity guru who exudes an easy bookish glamour,” said *Poets & Writers* in 2018.

She has advised everyone from shipping and private equity firms to festivals and a wide variety of advocates for the arts, and especially enjoys working on projects in London and across Europe. In 2019, she’ll work with *A Public Space*, the Windham-Campbell Prizes, and Daniel Handler.

Lauren has been described as a “talented publicist,” by the [*Wall Street Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-preparation-for-the-next-life-became-a-big-hit-for-tyrant-1421351378?tesla=y); “a social media pioneer,” by *Svenska Dagbladet* (Swedish Daily Paper); and a “specialist in literary social networking,” by the *Telegraph* (UK). 

She most recently appeared at the Mors Tua Vita Mea writing workshop, held in the shadow of castelletto ruins in Sezze, Italy, in October 2017, and covered by *Vanity Fair* (Italy) soon after.

She is on the advisory committee of Film Forum and a graduate of Cornell University. She lives in Brooklyn, where she is learning Italian and working towards a Jewelry Design and Marketing Certificate at Pratt.
